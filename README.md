# Naive Bayes Multinomial Classifier for Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews (From Scratch)

This project implements a **Naive Bayes Multinomial Classifier** using the **Bag of Words (BoW)** model to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. The implementation is built entirely from scratch using only **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Scipy**, focusing on understanding the inner workings of the algorithm.

## Project Overview

- **Algorithm:** Naive Bayes Multinomial Classifier  
- **Feature Extraction:** Bag of Words (BoW) model  
- **Task:** Sentiment Analysis on movie reviews (binary classification)  
- **Libraries Used:** NumPy, Pandas, Scipy (no external ML libraries)  

## Features

- Custom implementation of the **Bag of Words** model for text vectorization  
- Application of **Laplace Smoothing** to handle unseen words  
- Efficient **Probability Calculations** for classification  
- Performance evaluation with **accuracy metrics**
